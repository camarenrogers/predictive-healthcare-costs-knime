# Predictive Analysis of Medical Insurance Charges Using KNIME

This project explores the predictive modeling of medical insurance charges using personal attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. It was developed as part of my Master's coursework in Information Systems at Middlesex University.

##  Objectives

- Predict insurance charges using regression models
- Quantify the impact of smoking on medical costs
- Identify clusters of policyholders with similar risk profiles
- Investigate the combined effect of high BMI and smoking

##  Tools & Technologies

- **KNIME Analytics Platform**: for visual workflows and machine learning
- **Medical Cost Personal Datasets** from Kaggle
- **Data Visualization**: Scatter plots, box plots, and trend lines

##  Key Insights

- **Smoking** has the strongest predictive influence on medical costs
- **Age and BMI** also significantly impact charges
- Interaction effects (e.g. BMI × smoking) amplify risk
- Regression model achieved an **R² of 0.751**

##  Challenges

- Encoding categorical variables for KNIME’s regression nodes
- Node compatibility issues (especially Regression Predictor, Numeric Scorer)
- Difficulties integrating clustering algorithms due to format errors

##  Repository Structure
